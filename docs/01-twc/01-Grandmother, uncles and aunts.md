[Walter Curham](../03-Military/First%20World%20War.md) was born in 1894.  He did not marry. [Robert Charles Curham](04-Father.md) was born in 1897.  He was my grandfather.

Sarah's  husband Charles passed away unexpectedly in 1906, at age 53 in Thames. 

Sarah Gibbs Curham married again, to John Isbister in 1909. A child was born to the couple in 1909, John Spence Isbister. John had a daughter Joyce, my father's cousin, who we visited when I was a child. Joyce was glamorous and her partner had a restaurant and drove a Daimler, which impressed us greatly.

This death notice from 1938 is informative. Mrs Haag remains a mystery. My father was six at the time, but did not mention memories of his grandmother to me in later life.
