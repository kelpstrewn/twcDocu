My father was Thomas William Curham. I am Stephen John Curham.

My father was born in 1932 and died in 2023. I was born in 1962 in Auckland. We both have lived relatively conventional lives. 

My father's early life was exceptional. He spent the formative years of his life at the top of the [Waimana](01-twc/04-Father) Valley. These were depression and then war years. The family lived a subsistence lifestyle and managed a farm rather than owning it. He went to a district school, and MƒÅori was the language of his schoolmates.
 
I am the first of three children and my parents met in 1957 and married in 1960. My mother was a trainee teacher on "section" at Three Kings Primary where my father was teaching in 1957.  She went on to teach at Mount Eden Primary. My father was older and an established primary school teacher. He had completed a six form year at Huntly High School and then gone to training college at Ardmore for a year, where he lived in a hostel. 
 
From there he was sent to rural schools to learn on the job, first in the North of Auckland and then in Taupo. This all happened straight after the Second World War. A baby boom meant that teachers were needed, and that training happened in the context of a society that was transitioning from an all out military effort (the chaos, loss and fog of war, a centrally planned economy, individual freedoms curtailed) back to a time of peace. Ardmore Teachers College was housed in ex military base buildings with Papakura Military Camp close by. 
 
My father was required to do compulsory [military](03-Military/Peacetime.md) training and stayed on as a territorial soldier for twelve years after that. My mother, being younger, was less effected by these events. 
 
She finished school at Epsom Girls Grammar and worked for a time in the office of Harry Liddle Ltd, my maternal grandfather's construction company, which built [ petrol station infrastructure ](02-Infrastructure/Liddle-Construction.md). 
 
She then went to teachers college in Epsom, a milieu that seems to have been quite aligned with that of grammar. I was born a year after they married in National Women's Hospital, at that time housed in ex American military hospital buildings , to the north of the current Greenlane site. We lived in a square fronted kauri timber villa in Manatu St, Mt Eden, brought with a mortgage , with some assistance from my maternal grandfather.  
 
The impression here is hopeful, a young couple with a shared profession, coming both from families who occupied places of equivalence in the social hierarchy of the time, working their way into the middle classes. But this is at the surface only. At more depth there were profound differences that were to derail the relationship in the 1970's.
