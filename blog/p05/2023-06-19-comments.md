Most people looking at this will have my email address and/or can talk to me direct about what they know of the Curhams. 
 
This website is able to be accessed by everyone everywhere though, so there may be people who will find it and who may have knowledge that will make this better. Or you may just wish to comment generally, see below for the comments widget.
 
Please create a free github login if you don't already have one. No credit card details are required. Once that is done logging in and commenting is easy. 
 
I have also enabled commenting on some of the  miscellaneous blog posts, on beekeeping and on mapping.
