This is an investigation of mapping processes and links to my father's work as a geographer. This came out of a need to map a 100 acre bush block in the Waitakere ranges, west of Auckland.  I then moved to a flatter more farm like site, where easy public access is available. I made both a 3d map, useful for presentation purposes, and available as a downloadable model, and more traditional 2d maps, spatially linked to data and useful for ongoing management.
